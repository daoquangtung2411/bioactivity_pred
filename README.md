# Machine learning and deep learning for bioactivity prediction

### (Part of RTDS 2025 project)

##### Please find unit_test and examples to see how to implement the code

##### Supported bioactivity prediction using conventional ML with fingerprints or descriptions and Graph Neural Network

##### Currently supported:

##### **Fingerprint/Descriptors**

- ECFP (Extended Circular Fingerprint)

- MACCS keys

- RDKit Descriptors

- eRG (extended Reduced Graph)

- 5 versions of atom features for GNN

##### Ready to use code (including hyperparameter tuning):

- XGBoost

- Random Forest

- SVM

- ANN

- Graph Convolutional Neural Network

##### Current dataset:

- BACE regression and classification (MoleculeNet)

- FGFR1 (regression) [cite]

- HDAC2 (classification) [Tung D.Q. et al.]

*More update coming soon*
